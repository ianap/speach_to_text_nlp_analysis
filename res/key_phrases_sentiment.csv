0.9999403357505798,the ground,73,83,Will this also add on to increasing burdens for GPs? What would Healthier SG mean for GPs?How dispence of medications will affect your operations?,be honest and say that it is going to be certainly challenging for us on the ground where we actually have to face a potentially patients coming in from the politics system who were previously seeing politics because of the subsidized care that was available to them only in the politics healthy s g s supposed to level the playing field in some way yeah to allow some right citing where some of our community patients will be able to choose a family physician and stick to the family physician and hence therefore shift their care out of the politics system or perhaps even the outpatient specialist care if their conditions allow them to do so one of the challenges for perhaps maybe the mom and pop gps who have been operating in a style you know over the last 234 decades will find challenging finding the skilled manpower to help them out in the administrative taskings and indeed that is one of my concerns you know when  look forward to the healthier the scheme  certainly feel that it is beneficial for the patients but we can only benefit the patients if we have the requisite human resource as well as the ability to pull off all these changes that are going to be coming alongthe healthy concept of one family doctor one family when we actually do in practice is one family clinic not a doctor per se because it is a fact that the private market a lot of clinics are meant by low comes theres a lot of movement around clinics of the doctors themselves thats why it falls back to the system itself system is very important the ability to have the case notes being saved being documented very clearly allows for transference of care within a clinic group between clinic groups as well so thats how you are able to maintain that continuity of care and  think the governments going further than that in to maintain the standard of care t is a fact that in the clinical practice in the private setting gs might treat things differently the same condition the same kind of parameters you might have a different kind of operating or treatment style but the governments coming very detailed guidelines on exactly how do you tackle chronic disease in each stage and with the standardization of care patient can rest assuret is impossible to have the same doctor see the same patient all the time doctors need to go and leave we need to get married and have kids and stuff and like so think  hes absolutely right  was my patient for example certainly we want to see me however you see being his family physician would allow me to then educate him because  have got a long long runway you know ve seen for five years hes probably trusting me now right  dont have to worry that he is still second guessing my own opinion because  believe that he will have already decided that culture is a pretty decent gu no what if he says something m going to just take that as probably the truth you know unless m really really skeptical about that diagnosis at that point that hes put across now so this is exactly what  is trying to say so at this point  would say hey look  you know if youve got major problems youve got anything thats deferring or if youve got anything that you have a question about come to me however if its routine stuff you need a vaccination which ve already told you about f you just need to refill a prescription or if you just need to have something check up thats a minor thing and you know its minor because ve told you about it or then perhaps you might be willing to see someone within my clinic group itself you know be that a local or a standing doctor all my other doctors who are running my group because  trust them as well and hence thats why theyre in my group healthier as as  said it goes beyond just myself but also to the community yeah so it goes both waysyour podcastst will be a potential problem if the plans are not thought up properly because  think what will probably happen is that the polyclinic list or what we call the standard drug list will not have all the drugs within the drug list itself so  feel that there might be a little bit of confusion if certain drugs dont fall in the parameters of a standard drug list that would be number one number two as you have alluded to many doctors actually do have a profit margin built into the drugs that they sell as part of the running costs of keeping the clinic afloat so that is a genuine issue that we will actually have to look into ultimately cost will have to be covered so in some way it will have to be recovered in the form of either increasing consultation fees or perhaps maybe the ministry will come in to assist in the forms of subsidies etcetera but  believe that this has to be discussed before it is rolled out think that the current business model that my colleagues in g  land essentially have is essentially sort of piece rate they see individual cases and the charges then flow based on that episode f  were to put it in another perspective its almost like you know gig work that one does ts actually a singular sort of episode that you work on there are

little bit of confusion if certain drugs dont fall in the parameters of a standard drug list that would be number one number two as you have alluded to many doctors actually do have a profit margin built into the drugs that they sell as part of the running costs of keeping the clinic afloat so that is a genuine issue that we will actually have to look into ultimately cost will have to be covered

not a doctor per se because it is a fact that the private market a lot of clinics are meant by low comes theres a lot of movement around clinics of the doctors themselves thats why it falls back to the system itself system is very important the ability to have the case notes being saved being documented very clearly allows for transference of care within a clinic group between clinic groups as well so thats how you are able to maintain that continuity of care and  think the governments going further than that in to maintain the standard of care t is a fact that in the clinical practice in the private setting gs might treat things differently the same condition the same kind of parameters you might have a different kind of operating or treatment style but the governments coming very detailed guidelines on exactly how do you tackle chronic disease in each stage and with the standardization of care patient can rest assuret is impossible to have the same doctor see the same patient all the time doctors need to go and leave we need to get married and have kids and stuff and like so think  hes absolutely right  was my patient for example certainly we want to see me however you see

still second guessing my own opinion because  believe that he will have already decided that culture is a pretty decent gu no what if he says something m going to just take that as probably the truth you know unless m really really skeptical about that diagnosis at that point that hes put across now so this is exactly what  is trying to say so at this point  would say hey look  you know if youve got major problems youve got anything thats deferring or if youve got anything that you have a question about come to me however if its routine stuff you need a vaccination which ve already told you about f you just need to refill a prescription or if you just need to have something check up thats a minor thing and you know its minor because ve told you about it or then perhaps you might be

in my group healthier as as  said it goes beyond just myself but also to the community yeah so it goes both waysyour podcastst will be a potential problem if the plans are not thought up properly because  think what will probably happen is that the polyclinic list or what we call the standard drug list will not have all the drugs within the drug list itself so  feel that there might be a little bit of confusion if certain drugs dont fall in the parameters of a standard drug list that would be number one number two as you have alluded to many doctors actually do have a profit margin built into the drugs that they sell as part of the running costs of keeping the clinic afloat so that is a genuine issue that we will actually have to look into ultimately cost will have to be covered so in some way it will have to be recovered in the form of either increasing consultation fees or perhaps maybe the ministry will come in to assist in the forms of subsidies etcetera but  believe that

little bit of confusion if certain drugs dont fall in the parameters of a standard drug list that would be number one number two as you have alluded to many doctors actually do have a profit margin built into the drugs that they sell as part of the running costs of keeping the clinic afloat so that is a genuine issue that we will actually have to look into ultimately cost will have to be covered

not a doctor per se because it is a fact that the private market a lot of clinics are meant by low comes theres a lot of movement around clinics of the doctors themselves thats why it falls back to the system itself system is very important the ability to have the case notes being saved being documented very clearly allows for transference of care within a clinic group between clinic groups as well so thats how you are able to maintain that continuity of care and  think the governments going further than that in to maintain the standard of care t is a fact that in the clinical practice in the private setting gs might treat things differently the same condition the same kind of parameters you might have a different kind of operating or treatment style but the governments coming very

being his family physician would allow me to then educate him because  have got a long long runway you know ve seen for five years hes probably trusting me now right  dont have to worry that he is still second guessing my own opinion because  believe that he will have already decided that culture is a pretty decent gu no what if he says something m going to just take that as probably the truth you know unless m really really skeptical about that diagnosis at that point that hes put across now so this is exactly what  is trying to say so at this point  would say hey look  you know if youve got major problems youve got anything thats deferring or if youve got anything that you have a question about come to me however if its routine stuff you need a vaccination which ve already told you about f you just need to refill a prescription or if you just need to have something check up thats a minor thing and you know its minor because ve told you about it or then perhaps you might be willing to see someone within my clinic group itself you know be that a local or a standing doctor all my other doctors who are running my group because  trust them as well and hence thats why theyre in my group healthier as as  said it goes beyond just myself but also to the community yeah so it goes both waysyour podcastst will be a potential problem if the plans are not thought up properly because  think what will probably happen is that the polyclinic list or what we call the standard drug list will not have all the drugs within the drug list itself so  feel that there might be a little bit of confusion if certain drugs dont fall in the parameters of a standard drug list that would be number one number two as you have alluded to many doctors actually do have a profit margin built into the drugs that they sell as part of the running costs of keeping the clinic afloat so that is a genuine issue that we will actually have to look into ultimately cost will have to be covered so in some way it will have to be recovered in the form of either increasing consultation fees or perhaps maybe the ministry will come in to assist in the forms of subsidies etcetera but  believe that this has to be discussed before it is rolled out think that the current business model that my colleagues in g  land essentially have is essentially sort of piece rate they see individual cases and

different ways to monetize that you could pay for outcomes over a year if the individual that is registered to you does well or youve done the required sort of management steps that are required so there are different models that we can explore but what my two colleagues have said is actually important overall they must get a fair remuneration for the effort in time f  want to back check a

the system itself system is very important the ability to have the case notes being saved being documented very clearly allows for transference of care within a clinic group between clinic groups as

you know unless m really really skeptical about that diagnosis at that point that hes put across now so this is exactly what  is trying to say so at this point  would say hey look  you know if youve got major problems youve got anything thats deferring or if youve got anything that you have a question about come to me however if its routine stuff you need a vaccination which ve already told you about f you just need to refill a prescription or if you just need to have something check up thats a minor thing and you know its minor because ve told you about it or then perhaps you might be willing to see someone within my clinic group itself you know be that a local or a standing doctor all my other doctors who are running my group because  trust them as well and hence thats why theyre in my group healthier as as  said it goes beyond just myself but also to the community yeah so it goes both waysyour podcastst will be a potential problem if the plans are not thought up properly

built into the drugs that they sell as part of the running costs of keeping the clinic afloat so that is a genuine issue that we will actually have to look into ultimately cost will have to be covered

you know unless m really really skeptical about that diagnosis at that point that hes put across now so this is exactly what  is trying to say so at this point  would say hey look  you know if youve got major problems youve got anything thats deferring or if youve got anything that you have a question about come to me however if its routine stuff you need a vaccination which ve already told you about f you just need to refill a prescription or if you just need to have something check up thats a minor thing and you know its minor because ve told you about it or then perhaps you might be willing to see someone within my clinic group itself you know be that a local or a standing doctor all my other doctors who are running my group because  trust them as well and hence thats why theyre in my group healthier as as  said it goes beyond just myself but also to the community yeah so it goes both waysyour podcastst will be a potential problem if the plans are not thought up properly

the system itself system is very important the ability to have the case notes being saved being documented very clearly allows for transference of care within a clinic group between clinic groups as well so thats how you are able to maintain that continuity of care and  think the governments going further than that in to maintain the standard of care t is a fact that in the clinical practice in the private setting gs might treat things differently the same condition the same kind of parameters you might have a different kind of operating or treatment style but the governments coming very

you know unless m really really skeptical about that diagnosis at that point that hes put across now so this is exactly what  is trying to say so at this point  would say hey look  you know if youve got major problems youve got anything thats deferring or if youve got anything that you have a question about come to me however if its routine stuff you need a vaccination which ve already told you about f you just need to refill a prescription or if you just need to have something check up thats a minor thing and you know its minor because ve told you about it or then perhaps you might be

in my group healthier as as  said it goes beyond just myself but also to the community yeah so it goes both waysyour podcastst will be a potential problem if the plans are not thought up properly because  think what will probably happen is that the polyclinic list or what we call the standard drug list will not have all the drugs within the drug list itself so  feel that there might be a little bit of confusion if certain drugs dont fall in the parameters of a standard drug list that would be number one number two as you have alluded to many doctors actually do have a profit margin built into the drugs that they sell as part of the running costs of keeping the clinic afloat so that is a genuine issue that we will actually have to look into ultimately cost will have to be covered so in some way it will have to be recovered in the form of either increasing consultation fees or perhaps maybe the ministry will come in to assist in the forms of subsidies etcetera but  believe that

willing to see someone within my clinic group itself you know be that a local or a standing doctor all my other doctors who are running my group because  trust them as well and hence thats why theyre in my group healthier as as  said it goes beyond just myself but also to the community yeah so it goes both waysyour podcastst will be a potential problem if the plans are not thought up properly

little bit of confusion if certain drugs dont fall in the parameters of a standard drug list that would be number one number two as you have alluded to many doctors actually do have a profit margin built into the drugs that they sell as part of the running costs of keeping the clinic afloat so that is a genuine issue that we will actually have to look into ultimately cost will have to be covered

supposed to level the playing field in some way yeah to allow some right citing where some of our community patients will be able to choose a family physician and stick to the family physician and hence therefore shift their care out of the politics system or perhaps even the outpatient specialist care if their conditions allow them to do so one of the challenges for perhaps maybe the mom and pop gps who have been operating in a style you know over the last 234 decades will find challenging finding the skilled manpower to help them out in the administrative taskings and indeed that is one of my concerns you know when  look forward to the healthier the scheme  certainly feel that it is beneficial for the patients but we can only benefit the patients if we have the requisite human resource as well as the ability to pull off all these changes that are going to be coming alongthe healthy concept of one family doctor one family when we actually do in practice is one family clinic not a doctor per se because it is a fact that the private market a lot of clinics are meant by low comes theres a lot of movement around clinics of the doctors themselves thats why it falls back to the system itself system is very important the ability to have the case notes being saved being documented very clearly allows for transference of care within a clinic group between clinic groups as well so thats how you are able to maintain that continuity of care and  think the governments going further than that in to maintain the standard of care t is a fact that in the clinical practice in the private setting gs might treat things differently the same condition the same kind of parameters you might have a different kind of operating or treatment style but the governments coming very
