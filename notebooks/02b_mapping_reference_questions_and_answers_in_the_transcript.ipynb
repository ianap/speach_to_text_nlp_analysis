    "## Response mapping pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook contains a pipeline for mapping lines in an interview transcript to their corresponding reference questions. The pipeline takes into account the fact that the interviewer may ask additional questions related to the reference questions, and that an interviewee's response to a reference question may span multiple lines in the transcript.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipeline Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Loading the data__: The interview transcript, speaker classification results, and reference question list are loaded into the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Preprocessing__ (optional): The transcript is preprocessed to remove any unnecessary elements, such as timestamps or speaker tags. The reference question list is also preprocessed to remove any duplicate or irrelevant questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Mapping reference questions to interviewer's lines__: For each reference question in the list, the pipeline identifies the line in the transcript that has the highest matching score with the question using a text similarity metric, such as difflib matching score. The identified line is assumed to be an \"interviewer's\" line and mapped to the corresponding question.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Mapping interviewee's responses to reference questions__: The pipeline then identifies all \"interviewee's\" lines that occur between two adjacent reference questions and maps them to the first reference question.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. __Joining responses to the same question__: Finally, the pipeline joins all responses that correspond to the same reference question into a single record, creating a summary table that shows the question and its corresponding responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "This pipeline provides a simple yet effective way of mapping lines in an interview transcript to their corresponding reference questions, even in cases where an interviewee's response to a reference question spans multiple lines in the transcript. It can be useful for various applications, such as analyzing the content and structure of interview responses, or identifying patterns in how interviewees answer specific questions.\n",
