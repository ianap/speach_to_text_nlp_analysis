    "## Speaker classification pipeline\n",
    "---\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook contains a pipeline for classifying the speakers in an interview transcript into two categories: \"interviewer\" and \"interviewee\". The pipeline uses a reference list of interview questions and calculates matching scores between each row in the transcript and every question in the reference list. The scores are then aggregated at the average level for each speaker, and the speaker with the highest matching score with the questions in the transcript is defined as the \"interviewer\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipeline steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Loading the data__: The interview transcript and reference list are loaded into the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Preprocessing__: The transcript is preprocessed to remove any unnecessary elements, such as timestamps or speaker tags. The reference list is also preprocessed to remove any duplicate questions or irrelevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Calculating matching scores__: For each speaker*i*:  for each speaker *i*'s records in the transcript and each question in the reference list, a matching score is calculated using a text similarity metric. The matching score reflects the degree of similarity between the row and the question. Then for each question we select the maximum score.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Aggregating scores by speaker__: The matching scores are aggregated at the average level for each speaker across questions' scores, creating a summary table that shows the average score for each speaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. __Identifying the interviewer__: The speaker with the highest average score is identified as the \"interviewer\", while the other speaker(s) are classified as \"interviewee(s)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This pipeline provides a simple yet effective way of identifying the interviewer in an interview transcript based on the matching scores between the transcript and a reference list of questions. It can be useful for various applications, such as analyzing interview sentiments.\n",
