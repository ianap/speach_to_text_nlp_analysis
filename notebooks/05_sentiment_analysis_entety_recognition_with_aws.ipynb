    "## Key phrase sentiment analysis pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook contains a pipeline for extracting targeted sentiment for key phrases in interview responses using AWS Comprehend. The pipeline first identifies the key phrases in the responses using the AWS Comprehend Key Phrases Detect API, and then extracts the context surrounding each key phrase to provide additional context for sentiment analysis. The pipeline can be used to identify patterns in how interviewees express positive or negative sentiment towards specific key phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipeline steps\n",
    "The pipeline consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Loading the data__: The interview transcript, speaker classification results, and reference question list are loaded into the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Preprocessing__: The transcript is preprocessed to remove any unnecessary elements, such as timestamps or speaker tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Identifying key phrases__: The pipeline calls the AWS Comprehend Key Phrases Detect API for each response in the transcript, and selects only the top key phrases with a score above 0.99. These key phrases are then used as the basis for sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Extracting context__: For each top key phrase, the pipeline extracts the context surrounding the phrase by taking 10 words before and after the phrase in the response. This provides additional context for sentiment analysis and helps to ensure that the sentiment is targeted specifically to the key phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. __Detecting sentiment__: The pipeline calls the AWS Comprehend Detect Sentiment API for each extracted context, and records the sentiment score and sentiment label (positive, negative, neutral, or mixed) for each key phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. __Aggregating results__: The pipeline can be used to aggregate the sentiment analysis results across multiple interviewees and/or questions, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the sentiment towards specific topics or themes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "This pipeline provides a powerful tool for analyzing the sentiment expressed in interview responses. By identifying key phrases and extracting the context surrounding them, the pipeline enables targeted sentiment analysis that can reveal patterns and insights that might otherwise be missed.\n",
