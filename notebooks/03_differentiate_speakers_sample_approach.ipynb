    "2. To develop a simple metric that can be used in (1).\n",

    "In our approach we will utilise the list with \"interviewer's\" reference questions:\n",
    "1. For each reference question, we separetly calculate the best matching scores for each spk_0's and spk_1's lines in the transcript.\n",
    "2. Then for each speaker and each question we take the MAX mathcing score. Since we have a list of reference questions the output in this step is a vector with maximum matching scores. \n",
    "3. Then for each speaker we calculate metric by taking the average of maximum matching scores from step (2)\n",
    "4. A speaker who has the highest metric (from (3)) is the interviewer, because his lines are best matched the reference list of questions."
