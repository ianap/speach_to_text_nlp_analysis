    "## A Pipeline to Understand Topics and Sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "We may encounter multiple individuals from diverse demographics undergoing an interview in a real-life scenario. Therefore, on top of generated topics, we can build a pipeline for sentiment analysis to find how interviewees  are reacting to questions, and also analyze aggregated information on user affinity towards a particular question.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline consists of the following steps:\n",
    "1. __Data Preprocessing__: The input file is read and preprocessed to remove any unwanted characters or formatting. This is done using Python's pandas and re libraries.\n",
    "2. __Name the topics__: use a human-in-the-loop with enough domain knowledge and subject matter expertise to name the topics by looking at their associated terms.\n",
    "3. __Calling AWS Comprehend Detect Sentiment API__: The preprocessed data is then passed to the Comprehend detect sentiment API using the AWS SDK for Python (boto3). The API generates sentiment for each \"mock-inteviewee's\" each question answer text. \n",
    "4. __Aggregating topics and sentiments__: Both topics and sentiments are tightly coupled with answers. We will be aggregating topics and sentiments at question level and count the composite keys for each question. This final step helps us better understand the granularity of the answers per questions and categorizing it per topic in an aggregated manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis is inspired by this [example](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/get-better-insight-from-reviews-using-amazon-comprehend/)\n",
